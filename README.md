## Description
This web app aims to streamline inventory management processes for a restaurant by transitioning from traditional manual inventory tracking methods to a digital solution. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), the app will provide secure authentication using JWT, ensuring that only authorized employees can access the system.

Upon logging in, employees will have access to a centralized platform where they can view and manage inventory levels for different stations within the restaurant. The app will feature separate sections for the fryer station and the grill station, each displaying relevant inventory items.

Employees will have the ability to add new inventory entries directly from the app. When adding a new entry, they will select the station (fryer or grill) and input the quantity for the corresponding item. The date for the new entry will be automatically generated based on the current date, simplifying the data entry process.
